# Blackjack
My second ever project
This practice project was the second step in my journey to become a software developer

Fully aware of the bug with splitting the players hand and lack of features
they were left intentionally to learn how to use git and github as 
source/version control.

Bug(s) to work on
 - After player splits their hand, when the player finishes thier first hand
   the dealer will draw and reveal their cards before the player starts on the second hand

Features to work on
 - Add 5 more decks
 - Being able to select your wager
 - instant response to button press instead of pressing enter for every response
